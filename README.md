# Enafore

A somewhat unstable fediverse client with better support for Akkoma, glitch-soc, and Iceshrimp instances.

Enafore is available at [enafore.social](https://enafore.social).

See the [user guide](https://github.com/easrng/enafore/blob/main/docs/User-Guide.md) for basic usage. See the [admin guide](https://github.com/easrng/enafore/blob/main/docs/Admin-Guide.md) if Enafore cannot connect to your instance.

For updates, uhhhhhhhhh idk just follow me, I usually post when I fix or add things: [@easrng@cathode.church](https://cathode.church/@easrng). Patch notes are [tagged with #enafore](https://cathode.church/@easrng/tagged/enafore). When I remember.
